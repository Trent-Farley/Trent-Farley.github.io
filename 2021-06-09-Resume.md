  <li><strong>Pacific Northwest Turtle Tracking App</strong> - Western Oregon University partnered with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to create an application for Oregonians to take a picture of endangered turtles. I requested help to build this application in Xamarin Forms and .NET core utilizing the MVC and MVVM frameworks to present and transform this data. During development, I successfully led the engineering team through multiple iterations while creating several pages of the application and the overarching data architecture. 
  
  <li><strong>MealFridge - </strong>As a senior project, my group built an application that utilized .NET Core and Typescript. This project was centered around getting recipes by what’s in the inventory, searching by recipe name, and generating a meal plan based on personal preferences. During our iterations, I utilized multiple API’s to retrieve data to reflect onto several pages of the application. In addition, I was the ScrumMaster during several iterations while solving blockers.
